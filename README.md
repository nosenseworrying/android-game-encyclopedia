# Android Game Encyclopedia

## Description
This application is my first Android Application.  It used the GamesRadar API (now abandoned) to serve as a reference
for all kinds of video games. 
The features include:
* Up to the minute video game News Features
* A video game Browser that allows you to navigate through video games past, present and future by Platform, Genre or Name with the ability to sort results
* View related information such as a description, release date, ESRB Rating and review score for games
* Browse to Game Official Websites, Reviews, News, Screenshots and Cheats & Extras
* A video game search that allows you to find the game you are looking for quickly

The current Market listing is available [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.forthegamer.android.encyclopedia).
